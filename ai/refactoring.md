## Phase 3: Refactoring Plan Creation

Based on your analysis, create a prioritized refactoring plan that includes:

### 3.1 Issue Prioritization Framework

### 3.2 Refactoring Categories
Classify each identified issue:
- **Bug Fix**: Functional defects requiring immediate attention
- **Security**: Security-related vulnerabilities and improvements
- **Performance**: Optimization opportunities and bottleneck resolution
- **Architecture**: Structural improvements and pattern implementations
- **Maintainability**: Code organization and clarity improvements
- **Technical Debt**: Cleanup and modernization tasks
- **Compliance**: Standards adherence and best practice implementation

### 3.3 Detailed Implementation Plan
For each refactoring item, provide:
- **Issue Description**: Clear explanation of the problem and impact
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Why this issue exists and how it occurred
- **Proposed Solution**: Specific steps to address the issue
- **Files/Components Affected**: Scope of changes required
- **Risk Assessment**: Potential for introducing regressions (Low/Medium/High)
- **Effort Estimation**: Development time and complexity assessment
- **Dependencies**: Prerequisites and blocking factors
- **Testing Strategy**: Validation approach for the refactoring
- **Success Criteria**: Measurable outcomes and acceptance criteria

### 3.4 Phased Implementation Approach
Organize refactoring into logical phases:
- **Phase 1**: Critical fixes and security vulnerabilities
