  # Codenames50 Codebase Refactoring Analysis & Planning

  Please conduct a comprehensive refactoring analysis of this Codenames50 codebase and create a detailed refactoring plan. This is a TypeScript monorepo implementing a real-time multiplayer Codenames game with React frontend, Express.js backend, and MongoDB.

  ## Phase 1: Code Quality Analysis

  ### 1.1 Architecture & Design Pattern Analysis

- Analyze the implementation of clean architecture principles across packages
- Review the ports & adapters pattern implementation in the core package
- Evaluate the repository pattern usage and potential improvements
- Assess functional programming consistency (FP-TS, Ramda usage)
- Identify violations of SOLID principles
- Check for proper dependency injection and inversion of control

  ### 1.2 Code Consistency & Standards

- Review TypeScript configuration consistency across packages
- Analyze ESLint/Prettier rule compliance and potential gaps
- Check naming conventions across files, functions, variables, and types
- Evaluate import/export patterns and module organization
- Assess error handling consistency throughout the codebase
- Review logging patterns and consistency

  ### 1.3 Performance & Optimization Issues

- Identify potential memory leaks in React components and hooks
- Analyze unnecessary re-renders and missing memoization
- Review database query patterns for N+1 problems
- Check for inefficient Socket.IO message patterns
- Evaluate bundle size and code splitting opportunities
- Assess MongoDB indexing strategy effectiveness

  ### 1.4 Security & Best Practices

- Review input validation and sanitization
- Check for potential XSS and injection vulnerabilities
- Analyze authentication and authorization patterns
- Review error message exposure and information leakage
- Check environment variable handling and secrets management
- Assess CORS configuration and security headers

  ### 1.5 Technical Debt & Code Smells

- Identify large functions/components that should be broken down
- Find duplicated code that could be extracted to shared utilities
- Review complex conditional logic that could be simplified
- Identify tightly coupled modules that should be decoupled
- Find TODO comments and technical debt markers
- Assess test coverage gaps and missing test cases

  ### 1.6 Type Safety & Error Handling

- Review TypeScript strictness and potential `any` usage
- Analyze error boundary implementation in React
- Check for proper error propagation in async operations
- Review validation at package boundaries
- Assess union type usage and discriminated unions
- Check for proper null/undefined handling

  ### 1.7 Package Dependencies & Structure

- Analyze package.json dependencies for outdated/vulnerable packages
- Review monorepo structure and package boundaries
- Check for circular dependencies between packages
- Assess proper separation of concerns between packages
- Review shared utilities and potential for consolidation
- Evaluate build system efficiency and complexity

  ## Phase 2: Specific Areas to Investigate

  ### 2.1 Core Game Logic (`@codenames50/core`)

- Review the purity of game logic functions
- Analyze the action/rule composition patterns
- Check for edge cases in game state transitions
- Evaluate the board generation algorithm for fairness
- Review validation rule completeness and accuracy

  ### 2.2 Server Implementation (`@codenames50/server`)

- Analyze Socket.IO room management and scaling issues
- Review Express.js middleware and error handling
- Check MongoDB connection pooling and error recovery
- Evaluate the domain service layer implementation
- Review the FP-TS monad usage and error handling chains

  ### 2.3 Frontend Architecture (`@codenames50/web`)

- Analyze React component structure and reusability
- Review custom hooks for potential optimization
- Check Material-UI usage patterns and theme consistency
- Evaluate state management complexity and potential simplification
- Review responsive design implementation
- Assess accessibility compliance

  ### 2.4 Real-time Communication

- Analyze message type safety and validation
- Review reconnection logic and error recovery
- Check for race conditions in state synchronization
- Evaluate optimistic update patterns
- Review rate limiting and abuse prevention

  ### 2.5 Database Design

- Analyze MongoDB schema design and normalization
- Review query patterns and aggregation efficiency
- Check for proper indexing strategy
- Evaluate data migration patterns
- Review backup and recovery considerations

  ## Phase 3: Refactoring Plan Creation

  Based on your analysis, create a prioritized refactoring plan that includes:

  ### 3.1 Priority Levels

- **Critical**: Security vulnerabilities, bugs, performance blockers
- **High**: Architecture violations, major code smells, maintainability issues
- **Medium**: Consistency improvements, minor optimizations, code organization
- **Low**: Nice-to-haves, documentation improvements, minor refactors

  ### 3.2 Refactoring Categories

  For each identified issue, categorize as:
- **Bug Fix**: Functional issues that need immediate attention
- **Security**: Security-related improvements
- **Performance**: Optimization opportunities
- **Architecture**: Structural improvements
- **Consistency**: Standardization and consistency improvements
- **Technical Debt**: Cleanup and maintainability improvements

  ### 3.3 Implementation Plan

  For each refactoring item, provide:
- **Description**: What needs to be changed and why
- **Impact**: Files/packages affected
- **Risk Level**: Low/Medium/High risk of introducing regressions
- **Effort**: Estimated development time
- **Dependencies**: Other refactoring items that must be completed first
- **Testing Strategy**: How to verify the refactoring was successful

  ### 3.4 Refactoring Phases

  Organize the refactoring into logical phases:
- **Phase 1**: Critical bugs and security issues
- **Phase 2**: Architecture and major structural improvements
- **Phase 3**: Performance optimizations and consistency improvements
- **Phase 4**: Minor improvements and technical debt cleanup

  ### 3.5 Success Metrics

  Define measurable success criteria:
- Code quality metrics (complexity, duplication, coverage)
- Performance benchmarks (load times, response times)
- Developer experience improvements (build times, error clarity)
- Maintainability indicators (lines of code, cyclomatic complexity)

  ## Additional Considerations

- Review the existing CLAUDE.md and documentation for accuracy
- Consider the impact on deployment and CI/CD pipeline
- Evaluate the need for database migrations
- Plan for backward compatibility where necessary
- Consider the testing strategy for validating refactoring
- Plan communication strategy for team members

  ## Deliverables Expected

  1. **Analysis Report**: Comprehensive findings with examples
  2. **Prioritized Issue List**: All identified issues with severity ratings
  3. **Refactoring Roadmap**: Phase-by-phase implementation plan
  4. **Risk Assessment**: Potential risks and mitigation strategies
  5. **Success Metrics**: Measurable criteria for refactoring success

  Please be thorough in your analysis and specific in your recommendations. Include code examples where relevant and provide clear rationale for each refactoring suggestion.
